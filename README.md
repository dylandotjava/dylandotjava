# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I'm Dylan, A 17 year old Java & JS Developer from Wales.

### Stuff I'm working on right now:
- [Stereo For Discord](https://github.com/dylandotjava/stereo-for-discord)
* This is a Discord Plugin that allows users to unlock Opus Voice's true potential in discord-
* by allowing higher bitrates, stereo audio and an overall more pleasant experience.

- [Server Plugins (soon to be public)](https://github.com/ServerPlugins)
* ServerPlugins is a (soon to be) public Open-Source minecraft plugin hub,
* having ultra-light-weight versions of Essentials, A MySQL Economy and much more to come.
