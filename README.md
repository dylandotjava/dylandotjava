# Hello!

### I'm Dylan, 
#### A Java ☕ & JS 🌐 Developer from Wales.

#### I'm most fluent in Java.

-----------------

### Stuff I'm working on right now:

#### 💻 [Server Plugins (in heavy development)](https://github.com/ServerPlugins) 💥
* ServerPlugins is a (soon to be) public Open-Source minecraft plugin hub.
* Some of the things I'm making:
* An ultra-light-weight all-in-one style plugin for staff utility,
* A game-core esque plugin that handles just about anything you'd like it to using ultra efficient methods,
* A MySQL Economy that asynchronously uses an external ServerPlugins API for getting/setting,
* Auto-Updates for all plugins with GitHub (opt-in/opt-out)
* Full PlaceHolder support for all parts of any ServerPlugin,
* And many more things I have yet to think of :)


#### 🔊 [Stereo For Discord](https://github.com/dylandotjava/stereo-for-discord) 🔊
* This is a Discord Plugin that allows users to unlock Opus Voice's true potential in discord by
* enabling higher bitrates, stereo audio and glitchless silky smooth voice connections that you can *fall asleep t-* 💤
* I'm working on this regularly, Finding new ways to support newer versions of Discord with even *silkier* connections.
