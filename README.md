### My Projects:

- [Server Plugins](https://github.com/dylandotjavaorg/serverplugins)
  -  ServerPlugins is a project of mine to create my own server-in-a-box plugin set.
  -  The plugins are made in Kotlin, With Java variations available down the line.
  -  They're made to use as little resources as possible without sacrificing usability.
  -  Current Plugins include: [ServerCore](https://github.com/dylandotjavaorg/servercore), [ServerEconomy](https://github.com/dylandotjavaorg/servereconomy), [ServerAPI](https://github.com/dylandotjavaorg/serverapi), [ServerPunishments](https://github.com/dylandotjavaorg/serverpunishments) and more yet to come.
  -  These are all in early stages of development, with test branches coming out in the near future.

I have more projects yet to add, so I'll try my best to hurry up and make something.
