# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I'm Dylan, A 17 year old Java & JS Developer from Wales.

### Stuff I'm working on right now:
- [Stereo For Discord](https://github.com/dylandotjava/stereo-for-discord)
> This is a Discord Plugin that allows users to unlock Opus Voice's true potential in discord-
> by enabling higher bitrates, stereo audio and silky smooth voice connections that you can *fall asleep t-* ðŸ’¤ðŸ’¤ðŸ’¤

- [Server Plugins (soon to be public)](https://github.com/ServerPlugins)
#### ServerPlugins is a (soon to be) public Open-Source minecraft plugin hub.
#### I'm making an ultra-light-weight all-in-one style plugin for staff utility, 
#### A MySQL Economy, Placeholder handlers, Title supports, etc etc. Possibilities are pretty much endless.
