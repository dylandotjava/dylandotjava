### My Projects:

## [**NOREVIVE**](https://github.com/NOREVIVE)
  -  NOREVIVE is a team of people (me included) who've set out to make Kotlin open-source alternatives to popular mc-java plugins.
  -  The plugins are made with resource efficiency in mind, so rest assured it'll work just fine on any setup.
  -  Current Plugins include: 
  -  [NOCORE](https://github.com/norevive/nocore), An in-depth vital command addition mod. 
  -  [NOMONEY](https://github.com/norevive/nomoney), An economy mod with built in Redis/MySQL/MongoDB Support.
  -  [NOBANS](https://github.com/norevive/nobans), A user-punishment management mod that has built in proxy wide punishments.
  -  These are all in early stages of development, with test branches coming out in the near future.

## [**SCYTHE BOT**](https://github.com/Scythe-Bot)
  - Scythe Bot is a Discord Utility bot that I work on as the second of two developers.
  - I'm currently working on a Java Discord API (JDA) version of the bot to help ease the instability of using JS.
  - More methods and familiarity of language were two of the major factors in the decision to switch.
  - Rewrite is in very early stages of development.

## [Stereo For Discord](https://github.com/dotdylan/stereofordiscord)
  -  Stereo for discord was a project of mine that added the possibility of panning to Discord's Voice Chat.
  -  The plugin (until I released mine) was sought after and hard to come by, Credits go to Ryan.js for the original.
  -  A month or so after my plugin was released, discord got their act together (not because of me) to fix their voice modules, which completely patched all clients and plugins that abused the issue that enabled panning in discord voice channels.
  -  I was happy, not because of it being broken but seeing the toxic community of discord audio guys fade into obscurity.


I have more projects yet to add, so I'll try my best to hurry up and make something.
