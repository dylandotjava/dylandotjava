### My Projects:

- [NOREVIVE](https://github.com/NOREVIVE)
  -  NOREVIVE is a team of people (me included) who've set out to make Kotlin open-source alternatives to popular mc-java plugins.
  -  The plugins are made with low resource availability in mind, so rest assured it'll work just fine on any setup.
  -  Current Plugins include: [NOCORE](https://github.com/norevive/nocore), [NOMONEY](https://github.com/norevive/nomoney), [NOBANS](https://github.com/norevive/nobans).
  -  These are all in early stages of development, with test branches coming out in the near future.

I have more projects yet to add, so I'll try my best to hurry up and make something.
